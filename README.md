# scary_HacktoberFest
This is just a fun Halloween themed repo to create something for HacktoberFest!

HacktoberFest is an amazing opportunity to contribute to different repos to get a shirt and some stickers from GitHub and DigitalOcean. However, for the code to count we want to contribute some quality code. Therefore, the Hacksu team has created 5 different repos with 5 different skills to add some fun code to. Feel free to add whatever you want to the code to help make it better! Keep in mind that we control the repos and can see what you gets change so be cool :)

For this repo, it is time to create something spooky! You can't have HacktoberFest without October and you can't have October without Halloween! It is spooky season!
